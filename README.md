# QA-Project-2  

## Epic Weapon Generator  

### Creator: Luke Back  

### Objective:  

To create a simple app consisting of four services that work together to achieve functionality.  
Service 1 will render templates and communicate with the other three services.  
Services 2 and 3 will both generate random objects and service 4 will also create an object but one that is based on the objects generated by service 2 and 3.  
The application will generate a random weapon from service 2 and a random rarity from service.  
With these random choices combined, service 4 will provide an amount of damage calculated from a pre-defined list.  
Service one will then deliver this information to the user.  

### The scope of the project includes the following:  

-An Asana board (or equivalent Kanban board tech) with full expansion on tasks needed to complete the project. -An application fully integrated using the Feature-Branch model into a Version Control System which will subsequently be built through a CI server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine. -If a change is made to a code base, then Webhooks should be used so that Jenkins recreates and redeploys the changed application -The project must follow the Service-oriented architecture that has been asked for. -The project must be deployed using containerisation and an orchestration tool. -As part of the project, you need to create an Ansible Playbook that will provision the environment that your application needs to run. -The project must make use of a reverse proxy to make your application accessible to the user.  

### The technologies that are to be used include:  

-Kanban Board: Asana or an equivalent Kanban Board -Version Control: Git -CI Server: Jenkins -Configuration Management: Ansible -Cloud server: GCP virtual machines -Containerisation: Docker -Orchestration Tool: Docker Swarm -Reverse Proxy: NGINX  

### Planning, Designing and Tracking  

For planning I used a Kanban board on Jira to help me keep on top of what tasks needed to be completed.  
I can see what needs to be done, what is in progress and what has been completed.

I created a risk assessment to evalaute what challenges I may face during development and what action I could take to mitigate the impact.
