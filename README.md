# QA-Project-2  

## Epic Weapon Generator  

### Creator: Luke Back  

### Objective:  

To create a simple app consisting of four services that work together to achieve functionality.  
Service 1 will render templates and communicate with the other three services.  
Services 2 and 3 will both generate random objects and service 4 will also create an object but one that is based on the objects generated by service 2 and 3.  
The application will generate a random weapon from service 2 and a random rarity from service.  
With these random choices combined, service 4 will provide an amount of damage calculated from a pre-defined list.  
Service one will then deliver this information to the user.  

### The scope of the project includes the following:  

-An Asana board (or equivalent Kanban board tech) with full expansion on tasks needed to complete the project. -An application fully integrated using the Feature-Branch model into a Version Control System which will subsequently be built through a CI server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine. -If a change is made to a code base, then Webhooks should be used so that Jenkins recreates and redeploys the changed application -The project must follow the Service-oriented architecture that has been asked for. -The project must be deployed using containerisation and an orchestration tool. -As part of the project, you need to create an Ansible Playbook that will provision the environment that your application needs to run. -The project must make use of a reverse proxy to make your application accessible to the user.  

### The technologies that are to be used include:  

-Kanban Board: Asana or an equivalent Kanban Board -Version Control: Git -CI Server: Jenkins -Configuration Management: Ansible -Cloud server: GCP virtual machines -Containerisation: Docker -Orchestration Tool: Docker Swarm -Reverse Proxy: NGINX  

### Planning, Designing and Tracking  

For planning I used a Kanban board on Jira to help me keep on top of what tasks needed to be completed.  
I can see what needs to be done, what is in progress and what has been completed.

I created a risk assessment to evalaute what challenges I may face during development and what action I could take to mitigate the impact.

### Pipeline  

I used a Jenkins Pipeline job to automate testing  with the script created and start builds through docker.  
This would be triggered by a webhook I have set up between Jenkins and Github after any changes are committed to the repository.  

### Services  

#### Service1:  
Here we have the front end that receives a random object from both services 2&3 with a get request.  
These two objects equal a result from a pre-defined list with a post request. This information is then returned through a html file with render template.   

#### Service2:  
Here we have a list of weapons that generates a random choice.  

#### Service3:  
Here we have a list of rarities that generates a random choice.  

#### Service4:  
Here we have the pre-defined list where the random choices are equal to an amount of damage inflicted on the player with the specific weapon&rarity generated.  

### Testing  

To test the functionality of my code for the 4 services created I made unit tests and carried these out using pytest. I recieved 100% coverage and all tests.

### Issues Encountered  

I did encounter many issues during development as most of the technologies used are new to me and I need more time to implement them correctly.  
There was a lot of technical issues, most of which I managed to solve. This took up a lot of time and made focusing on technologies more difficult.  
However, developing this project has made me learn new skills which I can further develop and given me the experience of creating a mircoservice application.  

### Future Improvements  

I will add to the project when possible as I learn more and can better implement the technologies and achieve a perfect end result.
